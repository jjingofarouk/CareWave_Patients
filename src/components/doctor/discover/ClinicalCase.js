Approximately 10 hours after the procedure, torrential hematemesis and hemorrhagic shock developed. During emergency surgical exploration, no source of bleeding was initially identified, but intraoperative angiography revealed a fistula between the esophagus, which was dilated, and the left common carotid artery (Panel B, arrow). The artery was ligated, and hemostasis was achieved.

Laboratory findings are notable for chronic kidney disease (eGFR = 25) with associated renal osteodystrophy (â¬ï¸PTH, â¬ï¸Calcium), mild hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. Wasting syndrome is evident, with low albumin levels suggestive of severe malnutrition. Disseminated skin lesions raise concern for Kaposiâs Sarcoma (KS), though FNAC was non-diagnostic, and further biopsy is pending. HIV-related opportunistic infections, such as TB, have been ruled out by negative GeneXpert and urinary LAM. CD4 count is 554 cells/ÂµL, indicating preserved immunity. ESR is elevated at 60 mm/hr, suggestive of underlying inflammation or infection. Nutritional optimization and CKD management are initiated. The patient is under evaluation for disseminated malignancy, advanced HIV disease, and systemic infections, with diagnostic workup ongoing.",
